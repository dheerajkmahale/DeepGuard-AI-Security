## 🚨 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

### ⚠️ YOU MUST INSTALL NODE.JS

**There is NO way to run a React application without Node.js installed.**

This is a fundamental requirement - like needing Microsoft Office to open Word documents.

### Why Node.js is Required:

1. **Build Tools** - React code needs to be compiled for browsers
2. **Development Server** - Provides hot-reload and local hosting
3. **Package Management** - Installs required libraries (React, etc.)
4. **Industry Standard** - Used by ALL modern web apps (React, Vue, Angular)

### The Good News:

- ✅ Free and open-source
- ✅ One-time installation (~5 minutes)
- ✅ Used by millions of developers
- ✅ Works for ALL future React projects
- ✅ Very simple to install

---

## 📋 Installation Steps (Simple!)

### Step 1: Install Node.js (5 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://nodejs.org/**
2. Click the green **"Download LTS"** button
3. Run the installer (double-click downloaded file)
4. Click "Next" → "Next" → "Install" → "Finish"
5. **Done!** ✅

### Step 2: Extract & Install (2-5 minutes)

1. Extract `DeepGuard-AI-Enhanced-v2.0.zip`
2. Open PowerShell in the extracted folder
3. Run: `npm install`
4. Wait 2-5 minutes for packages to download
5. **Done!** ✅

### Step 3: Run the App (2 seconds)

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open browser → `http://localhost:8080`

**That's it!** 🎉
